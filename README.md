---
## 🔐 IAM Setup for Cluster Autoscaler (IRSA)

This section configures secure AWS access for Cluster Autoscaler using **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**.

---
### 📄 IAM Policy (Permissions)

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "autoscaler" {
  statement {
    effect    = "Allow"
    resources = ["*"]

    actions = [
      "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
      "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances",
      "autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations",
      "autoscaling:DescribeScalingActivities",
      "autoscaling:DescribeTags",
      "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
      "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions"
    ]
  }

  statement {
    effect    = "Allow"
    resources = ["*"]

    actions = [
      "autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity",
      "autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup",
      "eks:DescribeNodegroup",
    ]

    condition {
      test     = "StringEquals"
      variable = "autoscaling:ResourceTag/k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/${local.cluster_name}"
      values   = ["owned"]
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation

#### 1. Read-Only Permissions
The first statement grants **read-only access** to AWS resources.  
This is required for the autoscaler to **discover and understand the current infrastructure state**, including:

- Auto Scaling Groups
- EC2 instance types
- Launch configurations
- Scaling activities

---
#### 2. Scaling Permissions
The second statement provides permissions to **modify infrastructure capacity**, allowing the autoscaler to:

- Increase node count when demand rises
- Decrease node count when resources are underutilized

---
#### 3. Security Condition (Critical)

A condition block is applied to restrict scaling actions based on resource tags.

##### Purpose:
- Ensures actions are performed **only on node groups belonging to the specific cluster**
- Prevents accidental or unauthorized scaling of resources in **other clusters**

##### Benefit:
- Acts as a **critical security control**
- Avoids **cross-cluster impact**
- Enforces **least privilege principle**

---
### ✅ Summary

| Component            | Purpose                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Read Permissions     | Discover infrastructure state             |
| Scaling Permissions  | Adjust cluster capacity                   |
| Condition Block      | Enforce cluster-level isolation & security|

---
### 📦 IAM Policy Resource

Defines the IAM policy used by the Cluster Autoscaler.

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "autoscaler" {
  name   = "${var.cluster-name}-autoscaler"
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.autoscaler.json
}
```
---
### 🔑 IAM Role Trust Policy (IRSA)

Defines the trust relationship using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).
```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "autoscaler_assume" {
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"]

    principals {
      type        = "Federated"
      identifiers = [var.oidc_provider_arn]
    }

    condition {
      test     = "StringEquals"
      variable = "${replace(var.oidc_provider_url, "https://", "")}:sub"
      values   = ["system:serviceaccount:kube-system:cluster-autoscaler"]
    }

    condition {
      test     = "StringEquals"
      variable = "${replace(var.oidc_provider_url, "https://", "")}:aud"
      values   = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
    }
  }
  ```
---
### 🔍 Explanation
#### 🎯 Service Account Restriction

* Grants access only to:
```bash  
    kube-system/cluster-autoscaler
```
* Prevents any other pod from assuming this role
---

#### 🔐 OIDC Authentication
* Uses the EKS OIDC provider for secure authentication
* Eliminates the need for static AWS credentials

---
#### 🛡️ Least Privilege Enforcement
* The sub condition ensures:
    * Only the specific Kubernetes service account can assume the role
* The aud condition ensures:
    * The token is intended for AWS STS (sts.amazonaws.com)

---
#### 🏷️ IAM Role

Creates the IAM role used by the Cluster Autoscaler.

```hcl 
resource "aws_iam_role" "autoscaler" {
  name               = "${var.cluster-name}-autoscaler"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.autoscaler_assume.json
}
```
---
#### 🔗 Attach Policy to Role

Binds the IAM policy to the IAM role.

```hcl 
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "autoscaler" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.autoscaler.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.autoscaler.arn
}
```
---

✅ Summary

| Component            | Purpose                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| IAM Policy           | Defines autoscaler permissions             |
| Trust Policy (IRSA)  | Enables secure role assumption via OIDC    |
| IAM Role             | Identity used by Kubernetes service account|
| Policy Attachment    | Grants permissions to the role             |

---
### ⚙️ Kubernetes Service Account Annotation

Bind the IAM role to the Cluster Autoscaler pod using **IRSA annotation**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: cluster-autoscaler
  namespace: kube-system
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: <IAM_ROLE_ARN>
```
---
### 🔍 IAM Role Association with Kubernetes Service Account

This setup enables secure communication between a Kubernetes workload and AWS services using **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**.

#### 📌 What This Does

- Associates a **Kubernetes Service Account** with an **AWS IAM Role**
- Allows pods (e.g., Cluster Autoscaler) to securely access AWS APIs

#### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **OIDC Authentication**
   - The Kubernetes Service Account is linked to an IAM Role via OIDC
   - The pod receives a projected service account token

2. **STS Assume Role**
   - The pod uses the token to call AWS STS (`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`)
   - Temporary credentials are issued dynamically

3. **Secure Access**
   - The pod uses these temporary credentials to interact with AWS services

#### ✅ Key Benefits

- ❌ No hardcoded AWS credentials inside pods
- 🔐 Fine-grained IAM permissions per workload
- 🔄 Automatic credential rotation via STS
- 🚀 Follows AWS security best practices

### 📦 Example Use Case

Cluster Autoscaler uses this setup to:
- Discover Auto Scaling Groups
- Scale nodes up/down dynamically

---
### 🧠 Why This Matters

If you're still injecting AWS keys into pods, that's not just outdated — it's risky and lazy engineering.

IRSA is the **only production-grade approach** for:
- EKS security
- Least privilege access
- Auditable IAM control

---

### 📌 Summary

| Component              | Role                                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Service Account       | Identity inside Kubernetes                |
| OIDC Provider         | Trust bridge between EKS and AWS IAM      |
| IAM Role              | Defines permissions                       |
| STS                   | Issues temporary credentials              |

---
## ✅ Validation

Follow these steps to confirm that **IRSA + Cluster Autoscaler** is working correctly.

---
### 1️⃣ Verify Service Account Annotation

```bash
kubectl describe sa cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
```
### 👉 Expected Output

eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn 
annotation is present Correct IAM Role ARN is attached
---

### 🔗 Attach IAM Role to Cluster Autoscaler (IRSA)

To enable Cluster Autoscaler to access AWS APIs securely, attach an IAM role to its Kubernetes Service Account using IRSA.

---

## ✅ Option 1 — Patch Existing ServiceAccount (Recommended)

Use the following command to add or update the IAM role annotation:

```bash
kubectl annotate serviceaccount cluster-autoscaler \
  -n kube-system \
  eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::104824081961:role/eks-cluster-autoscaler \
  --overwrite
```
## ✅ Option 2 — Declarative YAML (Preferred for GitOps)

Define the ServiceAccount with annotation:
```bash 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: cluster-autoscaler
  namespace: kube-system
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::104824081961:role/eks-cluster-autoscaler
```
Apply the configuration:

```bash 
kubectl apply -f sa.yaml
```
---

## 🔍 Verification

Ensure the annotation is applied correctly:

```bash 
kubectl describe sa cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
```
Expected output:

Annotations:
```bash 
  eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::104824081961:role/eks-cluster-autoscaler
```
⚠️ Notes

* Ensure IAM trust policy allows:
```bash 
system:serviceaccount:kube-system:cluster-autoscaler
```
* Restart the autoscaler pod if required:
```bash 
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l app=cluster-autoscaler
```

### 🎯 Key Takeaway
This step securely connects Kubernetes with AWS:

* No static credentials
* Fine-grained IAM permissions
* Required for Cluster Autoscaler to function

---
### ⚙️ End-to-End Scaling Process

1. A workload is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.
2. The Kubernetes Scheduler attempts to place pods on existing worker nodes.
3. If sufficient CPU or memory is unavailable, pods remain in the **Pending** state.
4. Cluster Autoscaler continuously monitors the cluster for unschedulable pods.
5. It identifies the appropriate Amazon EKS Managed Node Group or EC2 Auto Scaling Group.
6. The desired capacity of the Auto Scaling Group is increased.
7. AWS launches a new EC2 instance.
8. The new node joins the Amazon EKS cluster automatically.
9. Kubernetes schedules the pending pods onto the new worker node.
10. When workload decreases, Cluster Autoscaler identifies underutilized nodes.
11. After the configured scale-down delay, pods are gracefully evicted and rescheduled.
12. The empty node is removed from the cluster and the EC2 instance is terminated, reducing infrastructure costs.

---

---
## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues encountered when deploying and operating Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler on Amazon EKS, along with their causes and recommended solutions.

---
### 🔍 Check Cluster Autoscaler Status

Verify that the Cluster Autoscaler pod is running correctly.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep cluster-autoscaler

kubectl describe pod <cluster-autoscaler-pod> -n kube-system

kubectl logs -f deployment/cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
```

---
### 📋 Verify Worker Nodes

Ensure all worker nodes are in the **Ready** state.

```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
```

Example log messages:

```text
Pod is unschedulable
Scale-up triggered
Increasing ASG desired capacity
Node group successfully scaled
Scale-down: removing empty node
```

---
### ☁️ Verify Auto Scaling Groups

Check the status of the EC2 Auto Scaling Group.

```bash
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups
```

Verify:

- Desired Capacity
- Minimum Size
- Maximum Size
- Instance Health
- Scaling Activities

---
### 🏷️ Verify Auto Discovery Tags

Ensure the Auto Scaling Group contains the required tags.

```text
k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled=true

k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/<cluster-name>=owned
```

Without these tags, Cluster Autoscaler cannot discover the node group.

---
### 🔐 Verify IRSA Configuration

Confirm the Service Account is associated with the correct IAM Role.

```bash
kubectl describe serviceaccount cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
```

Verify the annotation:

```text
eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=<IAM_ROLE_ARN>
```

Also confirm the IAM policy includes permissions for:

- Auto Scaling
- EC2
- Describe APIs

---
### 📊 Verify Kubernetes Events

Check for scheduling failures and scaling events.

```bash
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

Look for messages such as:

```text
FailedScheduling
TriggeredScaleUp
ScaledUpGroup
NotTriggerScaleUp
```

### 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Pods remain Pending | Insufficient CPU or Memory | Increase node group maximum size or reduce resource requests |
| No scale-up occurs | Missing Auto Scaling Group tags | Add Cluster Autoscaler discovery tags |
| AccessDenied errors | Incorrect IAM Role or IRSA | Verify IAM policy and Service Account annotation |
| Autoscaler CrashLoopBackOff | Invalid configuration or version mismatch | Check logs and use a compatible Cluster Autoscaler version |
| Nodes are not removed | Scale-down disabled or protected pods | Review scale-down settings and Pod Disruption Budgets |
| Node group not discovered | Incorrect cluster name or tags | Verify Auto Discovery tags and cluster name |
| Pods cannot be scheduled | Node selector, affinity, or taints | Verify scheduling constraints and node labels |
| Scale-up is slow | EC2 launch time | Use appropriate instance types and maintain a minimum node count |
